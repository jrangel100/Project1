### Project1

## Energy Production vs Investment
# In this project we are investigating the relationship between USDA investment in clean/renewable energy and the energy produced from these sources.
#   - Look at years 2002 - 2021
#   - Isolate the clean/renewable energy sources common among both data sets: biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, and wind
#   - Incorporate census population data in order to compare investment and production on a per capita basis
#   - Look at data on a state level and look for differences in production and investment between states
#   - Investigate outlying cases of under/over-investment, efficiency/inefficiency in production per investment, etc. 


## Data Sources
# Production Data: 
#       Data showing the energy production (measured in Megawatthours) from different energy sources, for each state, from 2001 - 2022

# Investment Data:
#       Data showing the investments made by various USDA agencies into various energy sources, for each state, from 2002 - 2021
